## More Than Just Bitcoin

When most people hear "blockchain," they think of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. But the underlying technology has the potential to be much more than a foundation for digital currencies. At its core, blockchain is a decentralized, immutable ledger that can securely record transactions of any kind.

## Use Cases Across Industries

This technology is being explored for a wide range of applications. In **supply chain management**, it can provide a transparent and tamper-proof record of a product's journey from origin to consumer. In **healthcare**, it can securely store and share patient records. And in **voting systems**, it could ensure the integrity of elections.

## A Decentralized Future

Blockchain's ability to create trust in a trustless environment is its most powerful feature. As the technology matures, it could pave the way for a more decentralized and transparent world, disrupting traditional business models and empowering individuals.
